Three implementations of Dijkstra Algorithm in three different kinds of heaps.
All the source code goes into src folder
All the compiled bytecode goes into bin folder

To run the code:
1. You can directly download the input_edges.txt and input_vertexs.txt files and run the main class in Dijkstra_main.java;
2. You can run WriteFile.java first to randomly create a graph and then run the main class in Dijkstra_main.java.
